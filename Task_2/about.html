                                Education makes the national development process fast. Education develops good political ideology. 
                                 The standard of living of its citizens is largely dependent on the level of education the citizens are able to acquire.

                                    Everyone deserves to be educated. Education is the first early investment for child development.
                                     Similar, for governments and nations, to make their country developed,
                                     their first budget allocation has to be on the education infrastructure in schools and colleges.

                                    Education grows as values. If you have the skills but don’t have the values then educated person become useless.<br><br>
                                    For example, many people are educated, skilled in many trades, but then they use their skills and education to cheat, disturb with creative fouls for society. That’s why it’s important for teachers, boards, syllabus creators to regulate topics to certain value (useful) goals. So that students, connect and focus on the good values and usefulness of their education for the development of society and country.
                                    Education has to be accessible to all.  Thanks to modern technologies and internet innovators. Due to them, now rural people, poor people, and people living in huts are able to get access to education through mobiles phones. Even they can show and guide their kids by becoming aware of the information that they are getting from videos, search engines, and social media.
                                  <br>  After a certain time, they can access online colleges, online schools, and universities. Especially those who are disabled and not able to afford the cost of the traditional cost.
                                   </p>
                                   
                               <br>
                               <p>
                                    We all have to ensure that there is no barrier to education for common people. For that as a teacher, you can educate values online, as a minister you can invest more time and funds on the rural areas for education development, as a social worker or NGO you can run educational awareness campaigns.
                                   <br> Education is not limited to academics and schooling. It’s more than an expansion.
                                   <br> For example, in any nation people need education (common sense) on various things:
                                   <br>1. Driving rules
                                   <br>2. Water consumption and savings
                                   <br>3. Environment Development
                                   <br>4. Organic farming
                                   <br> etc.
                                   </p>
                                   <br>
                                   <p>
                                        The value of education and its significance can be understood from the fact that as soon as we are born,
                                         our parents start educating us about an essential thing in life.
                                          A toddler starts learning new words and develops a vocabulary based on what his parents teach him.
                                           They educate him who is his father, mother, brother, sister, etc. 
                                           and how to behave with each person giving them due respect.
                                            They also impart him priceless knowledge about ethics and morals right from the beginning
                                             when he has a tender mind so that these qualities stay with him for his entire life in the form of conditioning.
                                       </p>
                                       <br>
                                       <p>
                                            How we behave with our parents and how much regard we have for our elders is a direct result of our initial education 
                                            in our childhood days. So it wouldn’t be wrong to say that a person’s initial education begins at his home.
                                             Parents guide their child not just into the first steps when he starts learning how to walk;
                                             they also guide him on the steps to be taken with behavior, morality, and respect.
                                           </p>
                                           <br>
                                           <p>
                                                If you look at the existing educational system today, you will notice that education has been reduced 
                                                to an exchange of instructions and information and nothing more.
                                                 Whereas in earlier times the motive of education was to infuse good values and morals in an individual’s consciousness.
                                                 Today we have drifted away from this ideology because of the rapid commercialization in the education sector.

                                               <p>
                                                    In today’s era, it is extremely important to know about the significance of a good education.
                                                     A good education does not simply consist of going to school or college to get a degree.
                                                      It goes beyond that. If someone is able to read or write, has gone to school and attained a degree,
                                                       it does not mean he has a complete education. This is just a part of the knowledge that makes him aware of what
                                                        is important in the world, and since most of the world wants a degree from him, 
                                                        he goes ahead and gets a degree. In this process,
                                                     he gets the capability to know what is important for him, what is wrong and what is right.

                                                        According to my own consciousness and its expressions based on my experiences,
                                                         I believe that an educated person is one who is able to adapt to his situations as per
                                                          the necessity of the hour. He should be able to utilize his skills and his education to overcome 
                                                          difficult obstacles in any area of his life so that he can take the correct decision at that moment.
                                                         That is what I believe make a person educated.
